<h2>Elections and Voting Systems</h2>
<p>
Here is a number of pages of my ramblings on about elections in Ireland and voting systems. I look at the ratio of representative delegates (TD's and MP's) selected using some electoral systems and how fairly they reflect the votes cast.

<li><a target="_blank" href="seatbounce2011.php"> 2011 Irish General Election</a></li>
</ul>

Overtime I intend to elabourate on this and throw in some other analysis.

<h2>Getting Found</h2>
In 2005 I gave a presentation to a company about getting there webpages found online. They had a basic non-CMS site, with some flash on it. I used this with the web talk above. In 2006 I recycled this presentation for a organisation and for a different dept with its own html site in 2007 I updated it and generated it as a PDF using MikTex, all propriety information has been removed, and specific site stuff.

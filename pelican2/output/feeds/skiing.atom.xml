&lt;p&gt;Well it I returned to Austria after some years aways, this time with the specker ski gang. I found the ski amade region was massive and had a lot of variety of skiing, to be honest i had never heard of it prior to it being suggested by one of the gang, probably due to the fact it doesnt feature in the Irish package ski hoilday itenery or in my weekend break ski book.
I was really impressed again by both the resort, and by the help of the ski lift people, particulalry when I was guiding a V.I. skier. Whilst the weather could have been better, the skiing conditions were excellent.
The Austrian set up of a hotel / pension with a three course meal each evening also meant the cost was reduced also saved us from the hassle of finding different dining places each evening.
It is far from a party zone where we were, and while we had some good nights outourselves, if thats what you are looking for other resorts are more suitiable i feel.
Overall it was a great holiday and no doubt it is a place I shall seek to return to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Ski Gear</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/ski-gear.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-04-02:pelican2/output/ski-gear.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Ski Gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the expensive parts of going on a ski trip is getting the gear. For me the basics are Ski Jacket, Salopettes, Gloves, and Ski socks. While you can use shades, having both shades and goggles is good. The rest you can rent.
As I am now a convert to wearing a helmet, a helmet is perhaps the easiest and best thing to get if you are getting more equipment, it is small enough to get into you baggage without extra charges flying.
For me boots are a crucial part of ski holiday i have always rented boots, and they have tortured me at times, in recent years the boots have got better, but I have toyed with the idea of purchasing my own, but have turned aways due to the extra baggage, hassle of bringing them and the fact in I often find my feet shrink when on ski holidays, or the boots dry or change so i end up switching them.
I cant see the value and benefit of buying skis, it takes to much to transport them, to a resort form ireland, and sharpening and servicing them is either up to you or you pay for it, so getting shop skis always suits me, it also allows you to try different types of skis.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang 2014</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on 2014 Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I was invited back by the specker gang, so i jumped at the chance when things worked out for me that I could go. Pretty much the same crew, and the same venue everything was expected. Was worried when told the first evening that I was to guide a totally blind skier, but somehows we managed it. Still those dreaded drag lifts annoyed me, but some of the runs particularly over near the austrian border were good fun.
The same format as the previous year, which meant things were less of a surprise to me. Some nights out, some singsongs and being beaten by a V.I.P. at the nail game.
Again an exellent gang to go aways with and I hope to go again in the future. While the resort is adequate many would welcome a change to a larger ski resort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2013-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well a leap into the unknown for me with the specker ski gang, guiding a V.I. skier for the first time went much better than I expected.
My initial worries were waylayed by the gang and I hope I proved that I could ski a little and guide a VI skier.
I was assisted by having to guide an excellent skier. Also hanging out with a guy who i know since I was ten, which is 30 years was another bonus.
Oberjoch is a small ski resort, with those dreaded drag lifts we detest, it is suitable for beginners and for the VI gang I think it was grand.
The set up of having a different restuarant each evening was good fun, including the mad frenchmans which was memorable to say the least. Some sing songs and visit to the (in)famous josefs had to be done.
Some memorable skiing moments, such as around the resevoir and off the piste, and some spills humbled us all no doubt.
A great bunch to go aways with and I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Saalbach / Hinterglem Take Two</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem-take-two.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2011-03-22:pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem-take-two.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well since we had such a good time the previous year we decided on a return to Saalbach, sadly we could not get to the same hotel, and the hotel we got while quite close to last year, was adequate, again it was difficult to ski home to it, and you were not high enough to ski down to the main gondola so a little walk was required. The set up was the same with a meal each evening, and the hotel had a sauna to warm those tired limbs. In hindsight storing the skis at the main lift would have been beneficial, but maybe we were blessed the previous year, our knowledge of the resort made is more aware of where to go and what to do and this helped us have an excellent trip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Saalbach / Hinterglem</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2010-04-01:pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well after a success of our trip to Kirchberg/Kitxbuel in 2009, we decided to give Saalbach a try. My ski book recommended it for both skiing and apres-ski, and it did not dissappoint. 
The accommodation in Pension Esian was excellent, the Sauna was much appreciated for the tired limbs, and the meal each evening was welcome. The chefs evening off was also a good trip up on the piste machine to the mountain challet resturant, and tobganning down.
The skiing was excellent, and myself and Ivan and Lee had the pleasure of on both the monday and friday following the hotel owner on a traverse of the resort.
The kitsch apreski madness of the HinterAlm and Allo Josef was another memorable experience.
Again as in Kirchberg, the austrians seem to blend the ski, apres ski and indeed value for money quite well. If i was to highlight some negatives it would be the fact that the pension was on one side aways from the apres ski main area, and the fact that to ski back to the hotel meant trying to negotiate the horrible black run, which wasnt suitable for us all. Better planning of your day would be needed to ski home and get to the apres ski, and choosing one or the other would be needed. 
The fact you could ski down to the main gondala from the door was a major bonus for the resort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/kirchberg-kitzbuhel.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2009-02-01:pelican2/output/kirchberg-kitzbuhel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ski Holiday in Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time skiing in Austria, and I was impressed.
Accommodation was ok, except for the walk home with skis, the pension/hotel set up with meals worked out well, served by a herr gruber lookalike. Some excellent skiing on tuesday, wednesday morning and thursday, although crossing the top of the mountain on wednesday evening and friday made me regret leaving the balaclava at home... St. Paddys day we flew the flag like 2 ejeets but it was worth it, kitzbuel much more lively than kirchberg. Ivan ran close to getting a slapping for his backward skiing...Lots of super crazhey dutch people about there for some reason. Ski lifts were never a problem, except for one incident on the 1st day with high winds. The farmers plate meal, always undid any good the open air and exercise was doing. Friday doing the Hahnenkamm (or the bit of it they let you do) was another achievement, and the spill I had on it, I need to pay off the paparazzi for filming it...
I found Kitzbuhel more of a party town, and kirchberg quite quiet and being based in Kirchberg meant we had to aim to get back there from skiing and  mean Kitzbuhel was a taxi ride aways.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Val Thorens</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/val-thorens.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2008-03-30:pelican2/output/val-thorens.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Val Thorens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third time skiing in France, this time in Val Thorens. I did find the resort very busy, but if you got through the intital lifts you could get to some areas which were clear. Overall the skiing was excellent, expecially on the clearer and higher runs. Some older lifts at the far end of the area was meant I invested in a balaclava/buff.
The resort itself i found very artificial and without character and the accommodation was adequate. I did like the fact you could effectively ski to your door, if you got high up on a late lift behind the resort although a well worn track had to be negotiated, and a missed turn could mean you were walking back upward to the apartment block.
It is a large ski area amidst a massive ski area, and a wrong turn could mean you had to by a one of ticket or bus trip to get back to the resort.
Some excellent skiing but the Resort itself i didnt enjoy that much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Serre Chevalier</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/serre-chevalier.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-04-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2007-04-02:pelican2/output/serre-chevalier.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Serre Chevalier, France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusual place, not really on the radar of many Irish holiday makers. It was a bespoke holiday booking flights, connections, skipack, and accommodation separately, and it worked out quite well. Myself i travelled to turin then onto Serre Chevalier, and returned to Ireland via Grenoble.
 A very french resort, in that foreigners were by far in the minority.
After some misgivings about the lack of snow we were rewarded by our choice of venue with ample snow on the mounts and runs we were on, granted as the day went on some runs got moguly and slushy but thanks to some snow the friday before we went and indeed on the monday(very interesting to ski in) we were blessed with good conditions.
I would say my skiing peeked on the tuesday and I was quite lethargic on the wednesday and for the rest of the week, I think my skiing has improved and I tested myself more then in previous years.
The part of serre chevlaier we were in Chantamerle was very french and very quiet - the next hub up in Villeneuve was much more party like but still quite dormant I would say. I found the people very friendly and managed many an communication exchange en francais. Whilst 2 of my traveling companions had a bad experience in one restaurant, for the rest of the time it was excellent especially in "Le Kitz".
As a resort i would say it is good for the intermediate or advanced skier and definitely not for the novice skier. The long black run Luc Alpand tested knees and edurance as you had to negotiate this to get home of an evening and then it was very cut up slushy and heavy, it the morning it was crispy and icy and much better.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Livigno Italy Two</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/livigno-italy-two.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2006-04-05:pelican2/output/livigno-italy-two.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Livigno Return&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well a return to Livigno in North Italy for some skiing. A very inexpensive trip it was our last minute panic resulted in us getting a very good deal.
I had some issues with going, since i had prefered les deux alps to livigno previously.
Ok the air trip wasn't the best, having to land back in dublin on the outward journey was a worry, however we got to bergamo and then faced the mammoth bus trip.
Accommodation this year was excellent, and the conditions were excellent for skiing since there was fresh snow, and Tuesday was brilliant trying to ski during a blizzard. Also the bizarre apres ski in the chalet on that day with dancing germans and dutch people, and the chef with the Indian head gear and knife in hand....
thursday night was a good night out myself an mike playing guitars and singing songs with some Danish engineers.
Over all trip was much much better than the previous trip to Livigno, it was excellent value, the ski conditions were excellent, all runs open, and clear since there wasnt the queues of previous years, my equipment was the best I had yet, brand new, ok some issue with the flights and bus trip but it was a great trip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Les Deux Alps</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/les-deux-alps.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2005-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2005-04-09:pelican2/output/les-deux-alps.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Les Deux Alps, France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well my first trip to france, was fine, 'cept for getting sick for a couple of days I did enjoy it. A touch more expensive than italy for skiing but the apartment was next to the main lift. Skiing conditions were not the best since there was not as much snow as you would have liked - up on the glacier was ok, it was one of the reasons why we chose a High Altitude resort.
The scenery was immense.
Got slagged for my ample Calves..... skiboot filling ones they are.
Nearly killed this dutch/belgian snowboarder, when he turned right in front of me, perhaps the highlight of my trip;)
The Apres Ski - what I could go to was grand a bit more fun than in italy.
I found the people very friendly - "Daccord?", especially when you tried the cupla focail francais.
Amazed at how much french you can remember - especially when you have to state your symptoms to the pharmacist, who helped me get back to myself. Of the week I missed maybe 2 days being sick, but thankfully got a good 4 days which was nice. Overall I think I preferred the resort to Livigno, a bit more expensive, but not the manic queuing, and "scamos" which annoyed me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Livigno Italy</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/livigno-italy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2004-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2004-03-31:pelican2/output/livigno-italy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Livigno my first skiing week holiday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well Livigno was chosen rather than andorra as our first week aways skiing. It is a few years since my initial skiing exploits when working and living in Norway, and this no doubt would be somewhat different.
It was package deal with Crystal Ski, and while it had some of the benefits of a package deal some annoyances like the accommodation not being great, and the bus link to the main lifts were a hassle, leaving you somewhat stranded and unable to get back to the apartment.
One or two of the lifts and runs were not working or available due to the weather and conditions of the slopes and this also limited our holiday. However there was some excellent sking over the montelino side and up high, and as ever one or two bumps and embarrassments par for the course.
There was some other annoyances such as a deposit on the locker which was only returned in part, an undocumented price hike in taxi prices, and a insurance on the ski equipment not included in the inital price which left a bad taste in the mouth pocket etc. One other thing was I found my boots and skis were not the best, perhaps I was blessed in Norway with top equipment, and the skis blunted by poor under foot conditions.
On the positives it overall was quite good value for money, some good apres ski,and despite bad weather around europe the conditions were good to ski in.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

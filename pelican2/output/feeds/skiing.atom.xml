&lt;p&gt;Well it I returned to Austria after some years aways, this time with the specker ski gang. I found the ski amade region was massive and had a lot of variety of skiing, to be honest i had never heard of it prior to it being suggested by one of the gang, probably due to the fact it doesnt feature in the Irish package ski hoilday itenery or in my weekend break ski book.
I was really impressed again by both the resort, and by the help of the ski lift people, particulalry when I was guiding a V.I. skier. Whilst the weather could have been better, the skiing conditions were excellent.
The Austrian set up of a hotel / pension with a three course meal each evening also meant the cost was reduced also saved us from the hassle of finding different dining places each evening.
It is far from a party zone where we were, and while we had some good nights outourselves, if thats what you are looking for other resorts are more suitiable i feel.
Overall it was a great holiday and no doubt it is a place I shall seek to return to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang 2014</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on 2014 Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I was invited back by the specker gang, so i jumped at the chance when things worked out for me that I could go. Pretty much the same crew, and the same venue everything was expected. Was worried when told the first evening that I was to guide a totally blind skier, but somehows we managed it. Still those dreaded drag lifts annoyed me, but some of the runs particularly over near the austrian border were good fun.
The same format as the previous year, which meant things were less of a surprise to me. Some nights out, some singsongs and being beaten by a V.I.P. at the nail game.
Again an exellent gang to go aways with and I hope to go again in the future. While the resort is adequate many would welcome a change to a larger ski resort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2013-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well a leap into the unknown for me with the specker ski gang, guiding a V.I. skier for the first time went much better than I expected.
My initial worries were waylayed by the gang and I hope I proved that I could ski a little and guide a VI skier.
I was assisted by having to guide an excellent skier. Also hanging out with a guy who i know since I was ten, which is 30 years was another bonus.
Oberjoch is a small ski resort, with those dreaded drag lifts we detest, it is suitable for beginners and for the VI gang I think it was grand.
The set up of having a different restuarant each evening was good fun, including the mad frenchmans which was memorable to say the least. Some sing songs and visit to the (in)famous josefs had to be done.
Some memorable skiing moments, such as around the resevoir and off the piste, and some spills humbled us all no doubt.
A great bunch to go aways with and I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Saalbach / Hinterglem Take Two</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem-take-two.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2011-03-22:pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem-take-two.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well since we had such a good time the previous year we decided on a return to Saalbach, sadly we could not get to the same hotel, and the hotel we got while quite close to last year, was adequate, again it was difficult to ski home to it, and you were not high enough to ski down to the main gondola so a little walk was required. The set up was the same with a meal each evening, and the hotel had a sauna to warm those tired limbs. In hindsight storing the skis at the main lift would have been beneficial, but maybe we were blessed the previous year, our knowledge of the resort made is more aware of where to go and what to do and this helped us have an excellent trip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Saalbach / Hinterglem</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2010-04-01:pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well after a success of our trip to Kirchberg/Kitxbuel in 2009, we decided to give Saalbach a try. My ski book recommended it for both skiing and apres-ski, and it did not dissappoint. 
The accommodation in Pension Esian was excellent, the Sauna was much appreciated for the tired limbs, and the meal each evening was welcome. The chefs evening off was also a good trip up on the piste machine to the mountain challet resturant, and tobganning down.
The skiing was excellent, and myself and Ivan and Lee had the pleasure of on both the monday and friday following the hotel owner on a traverse of the resort.
The kitsch apreski madness of the HinterAlm and Allo Josef was another memorable experience.
Again as in Kirchberg, the austrians seem to blend the ski, apres ski and indeed value for money quite well. If i was to highlight some negatives it would be the fact that the pension was on one side aways from the apres ski main area, and the fact that to ski back to the hotel meant trying to negotiate the horrible black run, which wasnt suitable for us all. Better planning of your day would be needed to ski home and get to the apres ski, and choosing one or the other would be needed. 
The fact you could ski down to the main gondala from the door was a major bonus for the resort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/kirchberg-kitzbuhel.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2009-02-01:pelican2/output/kirchberg-kitzbuhel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ski Holiday in Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time skiing in Austria, and I was impressed.
Accommodation was ok, except for the walk home with skis, the pension/hotel set up with meals worked out well, served by a herr gruber lookalike. Some excellent skiing on tuesday, wednesday morning and thursday, although crossing the top of the mountain on wednesday evening and friday made me regret leaving the balaclava at home... St. Paddys day we flew the flag like 2 ejeets but it was worth it, kitzbuel much more lively than kirchberg. Ivan ran close to getting a slapping for his backward skiing...Lots of super crazhey dutch people about there for some reason. Ski lifts were never a problem, except for one incident on the 1st day with high winds. The farmers plate meal, always undid any good the open air and exercise was doing. Friday doing the Hahnenkamm (or the bit of it they let you do) was another achievement, and the spill I had on it, I need to pay off the paparazzi for filming it...
I found Kitzbuhel more of a party town, and kirchberg quite quiet and being based in Kirchberg meant we had to aim to get back there from skiing and  mean Kitzbuhel was a taxi ride aways.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

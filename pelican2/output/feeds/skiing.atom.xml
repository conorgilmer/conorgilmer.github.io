&lt;p&gt;Well it I returned to Austria after some years aways, this time with the specker ski gang. I found the ski amade region was massive and had a lot of variety of skiing, to be honest i had never heard of it prior to it being suggested by one of the gang, probably due to the fact it doesnt feature in the Irish package ski hoilday itenery or in my weekend break ski book.
I was really impressed again by both the resort, and by the help of the ski lift people, particulalry when I was guiding a V.I. skier. Whilst the weather could have been better, the skiing conditions were excellent.
The Austrian set up of a hotel / pension with a three course meal each evening also meant the cost was reduced also saved us from the hassle of finding different dining places each evening.
It is far from a party zone where we were, and while we had some good nights outourselves, if thats what you are looking for other resorts are more suitiable i feel.
Overall it was a great holiday and no doubt it is a place I shall seek to return to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang 2014</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on 2014 Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I was invited back by the specker gang, so i jumped at the chance when things worked out for me that I could go. Pretty much the same crew, and the same venue everything was expected. Was worried when told the first evening that I was to guide a totally blind skier, but somehows we managed it. Still those dreaded drag lifts annoyed me, but some of the runs particularly over near the austrian border were good fun.
The same format as the previous year, which meant things were less of a surprise to me. Some nights out, some singsongs and being beaten by a V.I.P. at the nail game.
Again an exellent gang to go aways with and I hope to go again in the future. While the resort is adequate many would welcome a change to a larger ski resort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2013-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well a leap into the unknown for me with the specker ski gang, guiding a V.I. skier for the first time went much better than I expected.
My initial worries were waylayed by the gang and I hope I proved that I could ski a little and guide a VI skier.
I was assisted by having to guide an excellent skier. Also hanging out with a guy who i know since I was ten, which is 30 years was another bonus.
Oberjoch is a small ski resort, with those dreaded drag lifts we detest, it is suitable for beginners and for the VI gang I think it was grand.
The set up of having a different restuarant each evening was good fun, including the mad frenchmans which was memorable to say the least. Some sing songs and visit to the (in)famous josefs had to be done.
Some memorable skiing moments, such as around the resevoir and off the piste, and some spills humbled us all no doubt.
A great bunch to go aways with and I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

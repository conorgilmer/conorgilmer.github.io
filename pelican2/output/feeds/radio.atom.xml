&lt;p&gt;RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been deffered until 2017. After pressure from various groups, encluding the GAA, emigrant groups, churches,i and Irish community representatives in the UK. The Station has agreed to keep the service going until 2017, although have still committed to its closure, and plan a wind down of the service by reducing hours and power it seems, the announcement has to be welcomed and hopefully gives space and time for the value of the service to be appreciated by the broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Save RTE Long Wave Press Conference in RIA</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/save-rte-long-wave-press-conference-in-ria.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-01:pelican2/output/save-rte-long-wave-press-conference-in-ria.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Campaigners for the retention of the RTE 252 LW service host a press conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of interested parties met in the RIA for a press conference chaired by a diaspora rights campaigner Noreen Bowden, with a technical informaional presentation from Enda O'Kane a former RTE employee, and researcher into its services. Notable contributions were made including one from the priest and broadcaster Fr. Brian Darcy.
The arguments for closure seem solely on price, and in the scheme of things it seems a minor saving.
The ability of Long Wave to be received by people in the UK and in parts of Ireland with poor FM / DAB coverage seem evident, however the crucial arguement is the demographic who listen via Long wave, are older and the proposed alternatives for them either are not available, or not available to them. An elderly Irish person in the UK who use RTE Radio as a connection to home, from coverage of GAA sports to News and requests, see it a vital connection, and to say its no more unless you listen online or via satellite seems uncaring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Postponement of Closure of Long Wave 252</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-10-15:pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been postponed until the 19th of January. This is time hopefully where it closure will be reconsidered. And ways which the service can be used particularly to serve the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>RTE Announce Closure of Long Wave</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/rte-announce-closure-of-long-wave.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-09-30:pelican2/output/rte-announce-closure-of-long-wave.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE announce its intention to close down its long wave service on October 27th this year. I think this is a betrayal of the listners to this service, those in the west of ireland where FM/DAB is not dependable, parts of the North of Ireland and the Irish in Britain. It is especially underhanded since the reason for the abolition of Medium Wave, was that Long Wave was a better option for RTE and would bring about better reception in areas of the South of England. Also the 'listen online' is not suitble for the age profile who would use the Long Wave service.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;Well it I returned to Austria after some years aways, this time with the specker ski gang. I found the ski amade region was massive and had a lot of variety of skiing, to be honest i had never heard of it prior to it being suggested by one of the gang, probably due to the fact it doesnt feature in the Irish package ski hoilday itenery or in my weekend break ski book.
I was really impressed again by both the resort, and by the help of the ski lift people, particulalry when I was guiding a V.I. skier. Whilst the weather could have been better, the skiing conditions were excellent.
The Austrian set up of a hotel / pension with a three course meal each evening also meant the cost was reduced also saved us from the hassle of finding different dining places each evening.
It is far from a party zone where we were, and while we had some good nights outourselves, if thats what you are looking for other resorts are more suitiable i feel.
Overall it was a great holiday and no doubt it is a place I shall seek to return to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Eclipse IDE v NetBeans</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/eclipse-ide-v-netbeans.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-02-19:pelican2/output/eclipse-ide-v-netbeans.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse v NetBeans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have used both NetBeans and Eclipse from time to time, Eclipse i started using back in 2004 for java development, there is a lot you can do with it to meet your requirements. At one stage I found Eclipse faster than NetBeans but the more plugins installed in eclipse and updates to NetBeans i found NetBeans get faster. In general i found NetBeans better for me when i was doing a php project, and eclipse for java, the exception being using netbeans for java swing. I have only used Net Beans for a few years and it seems to improve each time, things like Java Hints,iand the GUI for doing swing dialogs found useful. Speed is still an issue i find with both, ofent just the editor can be quite slow, even with quite a modern machine.
As an apache ant user i found Eclipse suited me, I have only used maven on occasions and NetBeans is more suited for it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Will HTML5 kill off Flash</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/will-html5-kill-off-flash.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-02-01:pelican2/output/will-html5-kill-off-flash.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;As HTML5 grows hopefully it will see an end to Flash&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTE should be positive for this service and not trying to reduce its power and devalue the service so as the removal of it in 2 years would be seen as such a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased power on the transmitter, more diaspora focused programming, engaging with them and improving the service where it can be such as considering band changes in liaison with the ITU should this be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hosting a HTML/CSS/JavaScript static site</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/hosting-a-htmlcssjavascript-static-site.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-16:pelican2/output/hosting-a-htmlcssjavascript-static-site.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ways to host a static website or blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DropBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;
Github pages is excellent for hosting pages generated by static website generators, it doesnt process php so wordpress and dynamic sites are not catered for. Just set up a repository in your github account publist it as a github page, clone the repository on your local machine, and set up a site blog here and add and push it to github and voila&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;
Dropbox can host a website / blog for you so long as it is not dynamic. There is a number of apps to do so , &lt;em&gt;scriptogr.am&lt;/em&gt; is one such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Google Hosting &lt;/strong&gt;
Previously the old google drive you could host one by uploading your website/blog and changing the sharing permissions. Now you can still do it on the New google drive by zipping up your website and uploading it via a script. The script will generated a url for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Hosting Company &lt;/strong&gt;
A traditional hosting company you can host a static or dynamic site depending on your requirements. You need a method of uploading it either via ftp or ssh or even wget from the console on the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find github pages the easiest way to do so but both dropbox and google drive are good locations to have personal pages like an online resume or cv.
GitHub pages and many static site generators use "MarkUp" languages such as MarkDown which is great for publishing text and documents without formatting information.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Graphs in PHP</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/graphs-in-php.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-09:pelican2/output/graphs-in-php.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Drawing graphs using php&lt;/h2&gt;

About ten years ago, I began using LaTeX to format some informational documents using LaTeX. These tended to use MikTeX and generated into PDF's using pdfplatex. As a result I was often asked by academic friends to help them use LaTeX.
I also got into using various stylings to produce other documents for myself such as a Resume and Invoices.
What I like about TeX is that it allows you to produce documents consistently, and abstracts the presentation from the content, and allows you to after composing your document to then format it for differnet output be it pd, dvi, pdf or html.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Favourite Language</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/favourite-language.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-01:pelican2/output/favourite-language.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;These are my favourite computer languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Java - I think Java is so universal on many devices it is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C - I think c is the daddy of all languages in a way and needs to be learned since the concepts are universal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl - Always amazed how I often have to go back to Perl to do some tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python - More recently I have used Python for some data analysis, really impressed with using it with Anaconda.&lt;/li&gt;

Notable contributions were made including one from the priest and broadcaster Fr. Brian Darcy.
The arguments for closure seem solely on price, and in the scheme of things it seems a minor saving.
The ability of Long Wave to be received by people in the UK and in parts of Ireland with poor FM / DAB coverage seem evident, however the crucial arguement is the demographic who listen via Long wave, are older and the proposed alternatives for them either are not available, or not available to them. An elderly Irish person in the UK who use RTE Radio as a connection to home, from coverage of GAA sports to News and requests, see it a vital connection, and to say its no more unless you listen online or via satellite seems uncaring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Adventures with DocBook</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/adventures-with-docbook.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-11-12:pelican2/output/adventures-with-docbook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Producing documents with DocBook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the expensive parts of going on a ski trip is getting the gear. For me the basics are Ski Jacket, Salopettes, Gloves, and Ski socks. While you can use shades, having both shades and goggles is good. The rest you can rent.
As I am now a convert to wearing a helmet, a helmet is perhaps the easiest and best thing to get if you are getting more equipment, it is small enough to get into you baggage without extra charges flying.
For me boots are a crucial part of ski holiday i have always rented boots, and they have tortured me at times, in recent years the boots have got better, but I have toyed with the idea of purchasing my own, but have turned aways due to the extra baggage, hassle of bringing them and the fact in I often find my feet shrink when on ski holidays, or the boots dry or change so i end up switching them.
I cant see the value and benefit of buying skis, it takes to much to transport them, to a resort form ireland, and sharpening and servicing them is either up to you or you pay for it, so getting shop skis always suits me, it also allows you to try different types of skis.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang 2014</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-03-11:pelican2/output/oberjochbad-hindelang-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on 2014 Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany&lt;/h2&gt;

Was worried when told the first evening that I was to guide a totally blind skier, but somehows we managed it. Still those dreaded drag lifts annoyed me, but some of the runs particularly over near the austrian border were good fun.
The same format as the previous year, which meant things were less of a surprise to me. Some nights out, some singsongs and being beaten by a V.I.P. at the nail game.
Again an exellent gang to go aways with and I hope to go again in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Well a leap into the unknown for me with the specker ski gang, guiding a V.I. skier for the first time went much better than I expected.
My initial worries were waylayed by the gang and I hope I proved that I could ski a little and guide a VI skier.
I was assisted by having to guide an excellent skier. Also hanging out with a guy who i know since I was ten, which is 30 years was another bonus.
Oberjoch is a small ski resort, with those dreaded drag lifts we detest, it is suitable for beginners and for the VI gang I think it was grand.
The set up of having a different restuarant each evening was good fun, including the mad frenchmans which was memorable to say the least. Some sing songs and visit to the (in)famous josefs had to be done.
Some memorable skiing moments, such as around the resevoir and off the piste, and some spills humbled us all no doubt.

The set up was the same with a meal each evening, and the hotel had a sauna to warm those tired limbs. In hindsight storing the skis at the main lift would have been beneficial, but maybe we were blessed the previous year, our knowledge of the resort made is more aware of where to go and what to do and this helped us have an excellent trip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Saalbach / Hinterglem</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2010-04-01:pelican2/output/saalbach-hinterglem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well after a success of our trip to Kirchberg/Kitxbuel in 2009, we decided to give Saalbach a try. My ski book recommended it for both skiing and apres-ski, and it did not dissappoint. 
The accommodation in Pension Esian was excellent, the Sauna was much appreciated for the tired limbs, and the meal each evening was welcome. The chefs evening off was also a good trip up on the piste machine to the mountain challet resturant, and tobganning down.
The skiing was excellent, and myself and Ivan and Lee had the pleasure of on both the monday and friday following the hotel owner on a traverse of the resort.
The kitsch apreski madness of the HinterAlm and Allo Josef was another memorable experience.
Again as in Kirchberg, the austrians seem to blend the ski, apres ski and indeed value for money quite well. If i was to highlight some negatives it would be the fact that the pension was on one side aways from the apres ski main area, and the fact that to ski back to the hotel meant trying to negotiate the horrible black run, which wasnt suitable for us all. Better planning of your day would be needed to ski home and get to the apres ski, and choosing one or the other would be needed. 
The fact you could ski down to the main gondala from the door was a major bonus for the resort.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/kirchberg-kitzbuhel.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2009-02-01:pelican2/output/kirchberg-kitzbuhel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ski Holiday in Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time skiing in Austria, and I was impressed.
Accommodation was ok, except for the walk home with skis, the pension/hotel set up with meals worked out well, served by a herr gruber lookalike. Some excellent skiing on tuesday, wednesday morning and thursday, although crossing the top of the mountain on wednesday evening and friday made me regret leaving the balaclava at home... St. Paddys day we flew the flag like 2 ejeets but it was worth it, kitzbuel much more lively than kirchberg. Ivan ran close to getting a slapping for his backward skiing...Lots of super crazhey dutch people about there for some reason. Ski lifts were never a problem, except for one incident on the 1st day with high winds. The farmers plate meal, always undid any good the open air and exercise was doing. Friday doing the Hahnenkamm (or the bit of it they let you do) was another achievement, and the spill I had on it, I need to pay off the paparazzi for filming it...
I found Kitzbuhel more of a party town, and kirchberg quite quiet and being based in Kirchberg meant we had to aim to get back there from skiing and  mean Kitzbuhel was a taxi ride aways.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Val Thorens</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/val-thorens.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2008-03-30:pelican2/output/val-thorens.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts on Val Thorens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third time skiing in France, this time in Val Thorens. I did find the resort very busy, but if you got through the intital lifts you could get to some areas which were clear. Overall the skiing was excellent, expecially on the clearer and higher runs. Some older lifts at the far end of the area was meant I invested in a balaclava/buff.
The resort itself i found very artificial and without character and the accommodation was adequate. I did like the fact you could effectively ski to your door, if you got high up on a late lift behind the resort although a well worn track had to be negotiated, and a missed turn could mean you were walking back upward to the apartment block.
It is a large ski area amidst a massive ski area, and a wrong turn could mean you had to by a one of ticket or bus trip to get back to the resort.
Some excellent skiing but the Resort itself i didnt enjoy that much.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Serre Chevalier</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/serre-chevalier.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-04-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2007-04-02:pelican2/output/serre-chevalier.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Serre Chevalier, France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusual place, not really on the radar of many Irish holiday makers. It was a bespoke holiday booking flights, connections, skipack, and accommodation separately, and it worked out quite well. Myself i travelled to turin then onto Serre Chevalier, and returned to Ireland via Grenoble.
 A very french resort, in that foreigners were by far in the minority.
After some misgivings about the lack of snow we were rewarded by our choice of venue with ample snow on the mounts and runs we were on, granted as the day went on some runs got moguly and slushy but thanks to some snow the friday before we went and indeed on the monday(very interesting to ski in) we were blessed with good conditions.
I would say my skiing peeked on the tuesday and I was quite lethargic on the wednesday and for the rest of the week, I think my skiing has improved and I tested myself more then in previous years.
The part of serre chevlaier we were in Chantamerle was very french and very quiet - the next hub up in Villeneuve was much more party like but still quite dormant I would say. I found the people very friendly and managed many an communication exchange en francais. Whilst 2 of my traveling companions had a bad experience in one restaurant, for the rest of the time it was excellent especially in "Le Kitz".
As a resort i would say it is good for the intermediate or advanced skier and definitely not for the novice skier. The long black run Luc Alpand tested knees and edurance as you had to negotiate this to get home of an evening and then it was very cut up slushy and heavy, it the morning it was crispy and icy and much better.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Eclipse IDE</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/eclipse-ide.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2006-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2006-09-12:pelican2/output/eclipse-ide.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse IDE for Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using many IDE's in the past, JBuilder particularly, I happened upon Eclipse. Ok it is a big download, and does require a bit getting used to like any software package. The things I liked were the fact you could add plugins, add in JUnit, add in Apache Ant to run builds, have a built in server, version control, the thing which sold it to me was hot deploying with apache ant, like having one one build to deploy to your local server, or development server, and one to deploy on the test server.
I also liked that you could customise eclipse to whatever language/system you were using be it a legacy version of java, or C or another language.

&lt;p&gt;Well a return to Livigno in North Italy for some skiing. A very inexpensive trip it was our last minute panic resulted in us getting a very good deal.
I had some issues with going, since i had prefered les deux alps to livigno previously.
Ok the air trip wasn't the best, having to land back in dublin on the outward journey was a worry, however we got to bergamo and then faced the mammoth bus trip.
Accommodation this year was excellent, and the conditions were excellent for skiing since there was fresh snow, and Tuesday was brilliant trying to ski during a blizzard. Also the bizarre apres ski in the chalet on that day with dancing germans and dutch people, and the chef with the Indian head gear and knife in hand....
thursday night was a good night out myself an mike playing guitars and singing songs with some Danish engineers.
Over all trip was much much better than the previous trip to Livigno, it was excellent value, the ski conditions were excellent, all runs open, and clear since there wasnt the queues of previous years, my equipment was the best I had yet, brand new, ok some issue with the flights and bus trip but it was a great trip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Les Deux Alps</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/les-deux-alps.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2005-04-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2005-04-09:pelican2/output/les-deux-alps.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Les Deux Alps, France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well my first trip to france, was fine, 'cept for getting sick for a couple of days I did enjoy it. A touch more expensive than italy for skiing but the apartment was next to the main lift. Skiing conditions were not the best since there was not as much snow as you would have liked - up on the glacier was ok, it was one of the reasons why we chose a High Altitude resort.
The scenery was immense.
Got slagged for my ample Calves..... skiboot filling ones they are.
Nearly killed this dutch/belgian snowboarder, when he turned right in front of me, perhaps the highlight of my trip;)
The Apres Ski - what I could go to was grand a bit more fun than in italy.
I found the people very friendly - "Daccord?", especially when you tried the cupla focail francais.
Amazed at how much french you can remember - especially when you have to state your symptoms to the pharmacist, who helped me get back to myself. Of the week I missed maybe 2 days being sick, but thankfully got a good 4 days which was nice. Overall I think I preferred the resort to Livigno, a bit more expensive, but not the manic queuing, and "scamos" which annoyed me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Livigno Italy</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/livigno-italy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2004-03-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2004-03-31:pelican2/output/livigno-italy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Livigno my first skiing week holiday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well Livigno was chosen rather than andorra as our first week aways skiing. It is a few years since my initial skiing exploits when working and living in Norway, and this no doubt would be somewhat different.
It was package deal with Crystal Ski, and while it had some of the benefits of a package deal some annoyances like the accommodation not being great, and the bus link to the main lifts were a hassle, leaving you somewhat stranded and unable to get back to the apartment.
One or two of the lifts and runs were not working or available due to the weather and conditions of the slopes and this also limited our holiday. However there was some excellent sking over the montelino side and up high, and as ever one or two bumps and embarrassments par for the course.
There was some other annoyances such as a deposit on the locker which was only returned in part, an undocumented price hike in taxi prices, and a insurance on the ski equipment not included in the inital price which left a bad taste in the mouth pocket etc. One other thing was I found my boots and skis were not the best, perhaps I was blessed in Norway with top equipment, and the skis blunted by poor under foot conditions.
On the positives it overall was quite good value for money, some good apres ski,and despite bad weather around europe the conditions were good to ski in.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>

&lt;p&gt;Well if it had not got a stay of execution, today would have been the day that we lost the RTE long wave 252 radio service, a service enjoyed by many people in the UK from Ireland or of Irish extraction, the demographic who avail of this service tend to be older and not part of the internet generation so the alternatives advocated by RTE do not suit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE should be positive for this service and not trying to reduce its power and devalue the service so as the removal of it in 2 years would be seen as such a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased power on the transmitter, more diaspora focused programming, engaging with them and improving the service where it can be such as considering band changes in liaison with the ITU should this be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-19:pelican2/output/the-day-rte-would-have-closed-long-wave.html</guid></item><item><title>Hosting a HTML/CSS/JavaScript static site</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/hosting-a-htmlcssjavascript-static-site.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Ways to host a static website or blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DropBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;
Github pages is excellent for hosting pages generated by static website generators, it doesnt process php so wordpress and dynamic sites are not catered for. Just set up a repository in your github account publist it as a github page, clone the repository on your local machine, and set up a site blog here and add and push it to github and voila&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;
Dropbox can host a website / blog for you so long as it is not dynamic. There is a number of apps to do so , &lt;em&gt;scriptogr.am&lt;/em&gt; is one such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Google Hosting &lt;/strong&gt;
Previously the old google drive you could host one by uploading your website/blog and changing the sharing permissions. Now you can still do it on the New google drive by zipping up your website and uploading it via a script. The script will generated a url for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Hosting Company &lt;/strong&gt;
A traditional hosting company you can host a static or dynamic site depending on your requirements. You need a method of uploading it either via ftp or ssh or even wget from the console on the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find github pages the easiest way to do so but both dropbox and google drive are good locations to have personal pages like an online resume or cv.
GitHub pages and many static site generators use "MarkUp" languages such as MarkDown which is great for publishing text and documents without formatting information.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-16:pelican2/output/hosting-a-htmlcssjavascript-static-site.html</guid></item><item><title>Static website generators</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/static-website-generators.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Static site generators I have looked at recently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to CMS's I have looked at static website generators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelican - Static site generator using python which these pages are generated by - &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/" title="get pelican blog"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jekyll - Static site generator using ruby - &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyde - Static site generator using python &lt;a href="http://hyde.github.io/"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikola - Static site generator - &lt;a href="http://http://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JBake - Static site generator - &lt;a href="http://http://www.jbake.org/"&gt;JBake&lt;/a&gt;
One thing I like about Pelican is the plugin to use LaTeX.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been deffered until 2017. After pressure from various groups, encluding the GAA, emigrant groups, churches,i and Irish community representatives in the UK. The Station has agreed to keep the service going until 2017, although have still committed to its closure, and plan a wind down of the service by reducing hours and power it seems, the announcement has to be welcomed and hopefully gives space and time for the value of the service to be appreciated by the broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-20:pelican2/output/long-wave-will-be-kept-on-air-until-2017.html</guid></item><item><title>Using TeX to write documents</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/using-tex-to-write-documents.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Acadmeic document formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to TeX(http://www.tex.org) was many moons ago in college, while my reports were typed up using wordperfect formating them subsequently to TeX for its calculus equations was necessary.
About ten years ago, I began using LaTeX to format some informational documents using LaTeX. These tended to use MikTeX and generated into PDF's using pdfplatex. As a result I was often asked by academic friends to help them use LaTeX.
I also got into using various stylings to produce other documents for myself such as a Resume and Invoices.
What I like about TeX is that it allows you to produce documents consistently, and abstracts the presentation from the content, and allows you to after composing your document to then format it for differnet output be it pd, dvi, pdf or html.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-12:pelican2/output/using-tex-to-write-documents.html</guid></item><item><title>Favourite Language</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/favourite-language.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;These are my favourite computer languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an evening out with some other IT guys, we got discussing our favourite computer language and why, so I decided to list mine.
&lt;em&gt; Java - I think Java is so universal on many devices it is essential.
&lt;/em&gt; C - I think c is the daddy of all languages in a way and needs to be learned since the concepts are universal
&lt;em&gt; Perl - Always amazed how I often have to go back to Perl to do some tasks.
&lt;/em&gt; Python - More recently I have used Python for some data analysis, really impressed with using it with Anaconda.
* JavaScript - is the last language I would add to the list, more so because its gets you programming for a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-01:pelican2/output/favourite-language.html</guid></item><item><title>Save RTE Long Wave Press Conference in RIA</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/save-rte-long-wave-press-conference-in-ria.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Campaigners for the retention of the RTE 252 LW service host a press conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of interested parties met in the RIA for a press conference chaired by a diaspora rights campaigner Noreen Bowden, with a technical informaional presentation from Enda O'Kane a former RTE employee, and researcher into its services. Notable contributions were made including one from the priest and broadcaster Fr. Brian Darcy.
The arguments for closure seem solely on price, and in the scheme of things it seems a minor saving.
The ability of Long Wave to be received by people in the UK and in parts of Ireland with poor FM / DAB coverage seem evident, however the crucial arguement is the demographic who listen via Long wave, are older and the proposed alternatives for them either are not available, or not available to them. An elderly Irish person in the UK who use RTE Radio as a connection to home, from coverage of GAA sports to News and requests, see it a vital connection, and to say its no more unless you listen online or via satellite seems uncaring.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-01:pelican2/output/save-rte-long-wave-press-conference-in-ria.html</guid></item><item><title>Adventures with DocBook</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/adventures-with-docbook.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Producing documents with DocBook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago, i was introduced to using docbook for document production by a former colleague, and uber geek. Setting up a framework for document production which produced consistent professional looking documents with the ability to produce documents in differnet formats (RTF, PDF and HTML). Since XML/XSL was all the rage using DocBook seemed consistent with other technologies we were advocating and using. I suppose someone who had used LaTeX I was interested in it and used it, but always felt well this could have been done in LaTeX and also setting things up on a new machine or os seemed to take more time than I imagined it would have with LaTex.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-11-12:pelican2/output/adventures-with-docbook.html</guid></item><item><title>Adventures with TeX</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/adventures-with-tex.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Producing documents with LaTeX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who is interested in information and document production technologies TeX was always going to feature. I used TeX a bit for some college documents particularly to do nice neat mathematics equations. Some years ago I got into doing academcic styled how-to documents in work and LaTex(&lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org"&gt;http://www.latex-project.org&lt;/a&gt;) seemed appropriate, since i would want it either as a PDF or in HTML on the LAN server, since it was a windows environment I was using MikTeX(&lt;a href="http://www.miktex.org"&gt;http://www.miktex.org&lt;/a&gt;), progressing on to using LaTeX for a presentation I had to give to colleages, and even rendering some notes to HTML. I migrated to TexLive and using Ubuntu for a while and all my letters and invoices were done in TeX. I have lapsed some what recently from using it but it may recently got back into it a bit in tandem with using static site generators .&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-11-11:pelican2/output/adventures-with-tex.html</guid></item><item><title>Postponement of Closure of Long Wave 252</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been postponed until the 19th of January. This is time hopefully where it closure will be reconsidered.

&lt;p&gt;RTE announce its intention to close down its long wave service on October 27th this year. I think this is a betrayal of the listners to this service, those in the west of ireland where FM/DAB is not dependable, parts of the North of Ireland and the Irish in Britain. It is especially underhanded since the reason for the abolition of Medium Wave, was that Long Wave was a better option for RTE and would bring about better reception in areas of the South of England. Also the 'listen online' is not suitble for the age profile who would use the Long Wave service.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-09-30:pelican2/output/rte-announce-closure-of-long-wave.html</guid></item><item><title>Python - Anaconda</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/python-anaconda.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Data Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is such an omnipresent CMS now it is hard to avoid, here are a list of my favourite plugins to enhance the functionality of it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact Form 7 (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JetPack (some free some paid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google XML Sitemaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Composer (Paid ~ €20a)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options Framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soliloquy (slider)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wordpress SEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wordpress Backup to Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share Buttons by AddToAny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can get plugins to add stats, I tend to add the code via the editor to the footer
+ Google Analytics 
+ Piwik &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-08-10:pelican2/output/wordpress-plugins.html</guid></item><item><title>Eclipse IDE</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/eclipse-ide.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse IDE for Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using many IDE's in the past, JBuilder particularly, I happened upon Eclipse. Ok it is a big download, and does require a bit getting used to like any software package. The things I liked were the fact you could add plugins, add in JUnit, add in Apache Ant to run builds, have a built in server, version control, the thing which sold it to me was hot deploying with apache ant, like having one one build to deploy to your local server, or development server, and one to deploy on the test server.
I also liked that you could customise eclipse to whatever language/system you were using be it a legacy version of java, or C or another language.
Eclips - &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org"&gt;http://www.eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt;

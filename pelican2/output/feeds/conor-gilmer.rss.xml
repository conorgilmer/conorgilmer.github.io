&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to CMS's I have looked at static website generators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelican - Static site generator using python which these pages are generated by - &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jekyll - Static site generator using ruby - &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyde - Static site generator using python &lt;a href="http://hyde.github.io/"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been deffered until 2017. After pressure from various groups, encluding the GAA, emigrant groups, churches,i and Irish community representatives in the UK. The Station has agreed to keep the service going until 2017, although have still committed to its closure, and plan a wind down of the service by reducing hours and power it seems, the announcement has to be welcomed and hopefully gives space and time for the value of the service to be appreciated by the broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-20:pelican2/output/long-wave-will-be-kept-on-air-until-2017.html</guid></item><item><title>Using TeX to write documents</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/using-tex-to-write-documents.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Acadmeic document formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to TeX(http://www.tex.org) was many moons ago in college, while my reports were typed up using wordperfect formating them subsequently to TeX for its calculus equations was necessary.
About ten years ago, I began using LaTeX to format some informational documents using LaTeX. These tended to use MikTeX and generated into PDF's using pdfplatex. As a result I was often asked by academic friends to help them use LaTeX.
I also got into using various stylings to produce other documents for myself such as a Resume and Invoices.
What I like about TeX is that it allows you to produce documents consistently, and abstracts the presentation from the content, and allows you to after composing your document to then format it for differnet output be it pd, dvi, pdf or html.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-12:pelican2/output/using-tex-to-write-documents.html</guid></item><item><title>My Favourite Language</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/my-favourite-language.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;This is my favourite computer language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java - I think Java is so universal on many devices it is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl - Always amazed how I often have to go back to Perl to do some tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python - More recently I have used Python for some data analysis, really impressed with using it with Anaconda.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of interested parties met in the RIA for a press conference chaired by a diaspora rights campaigner Noreen Bowden, with a technical informaional presentation from Enda O'Kane a former RTE employee, and researcher into its services. Notable contributions were made including one from the priest and broadcaster Fr. Brian Darcy.
The arguments for closure seem solely on price, and in the scheme of things it seems a minor saving.
The ability of Long Wave to be received by people in the UK and in parts of Ireland with poor FM / DAB coverage seem evident, however the crucial arguement is the demographic who listen via Long wave, are older and the proposed alternatives for them either are not available, or not available to them. An elderly Irish person in the UK who use RTE Radio as a connection to home, from coverage of GAA sports to News and requests, see it a vital connection, and to say its no more unless you listen online or via satellite seems uncaring.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-01:pelican2/output/save-rte-long-wave-press-conference-in-ria.html</guid></item><item><title>Postponement of Closure of Long Wave 252</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been postponed until the 19th of January. This is time hopefully where it closure will be reconsidered. And ways which the service can be used particularly to serve the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-10-15:pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html</guid></item><item><title>RTE Announce Closure of Long Wave</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/rte-announce-closure-of-long-wave.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE announce its intention to close down its long wave service on October 27th this year. I think this is a betrayal of the listners to this service, those in the west of ireland where FM/DAB is not dependable, parts of the North of Ireland and the Irish in Britain. It is especially underhanded since the reason for the abolition of Medium Wave, was that Long Wave was a better option for RTE and would bring about better reception in areas of the South of England. Also the 'listen online' is not suitble for the age profile who would use the Long Wave service.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-09-30:pelican2/output/rte-announce-closure-of-long-wave.html</guid></item><item><title>Python - Anaconda</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/python-anaconda.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Data Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was convinced to try Python for some data manipulation and analytic task, and I really impressed. I have just discovered using Anaconda for python and the idea and way you can run pyton within a browser must make this an excellent tool for teaching the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Conor Gilmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-09-09:pelican2/output/python-anaconda.html</guid></item><item><title>Eclipse IDE</title><link>http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/eclipse-ide.html</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse IDE for Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using many IDE's in the past, JBuilder particularly, I happened upon Eclipse. Ok it is a big download, and does require a bit getting used to like any software package. The things I liked were the fact you could add plugins, add in JUnit, add in Apache Ant to run builds, have a built in server, version control, the thing which sold it to me was hot deploying with apache ant, like having one one build to deploy to your local server, or development server, and one to deploy on the test server.
I also liked that you could customise eclipse to whatever language/system you were using be it a legacy version of java, or C or another language.

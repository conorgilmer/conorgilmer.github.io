&lt;p&gt;Have used both NetBeans and Eclipse from time to time, Eclipse i started using back in 2004 for java development, there is a lot you can do with it to meet your requirements. At one stage I found Eclipse faster than NetBeans but the more plugins installed in eclipse and updates to NetBeans i found NetBeans get faster. In general i found NetBeans better for me when i was doing a php project, and eclipse for java, the exception being using netbeans for java swing. I have only used Net Beans for a few years and it seems to improve each time, things like Java Hints,iand the GUI for doing swing dialogs found useful. Speed is still an issue i find with both, ofent just the editor can be quite slow, even with quite a modern machine.
As an apache ant user i found Eclipse suited me, I have only used maven on occasions and NetBeans is more suited for it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Will HTML5 kill off Flash</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/will-html5-kill-off-flash.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-02-01:pelican2/output/will-html5-kill-off-flash.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;As HTML5 grows hopefully it will see an end to Flash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be nigh on 15 years when I did my first and really only major Flash project an online information brochure with animation, nowadays some platform or templating framework would be a quicker to access and customise,  more web friendly and independent of using a plugin to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While flash has a role for animations and games maybe for web content HTML5 must be a better solution, more open, not needing a download to render it, even with conversion programs to convert flash to html5, surely using pure html5 is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move by youtube to default to html5 is another indication that HTML5 will spell an end to Flash.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The day RTE would have closed Long Wave</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/the-day-rte-would-have-closed-long-wave.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-19:pelican2/output/the-day-rte-would-have-closed-long-wave.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Today would have been the day that RTE closed its long wave service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well if it had not got a stay of execution, today would have been the day that we lost the RTE long wave 252 radio service, a service enjoyed by many people in the UK from Ireland or of Irish extraction, the demographic who avail of this service tend to be older and not part of the internet generation so the alternatives advocated by RTE do not suit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTE should be positive for this service and not trying to reduce its power and devalue the service so as the removal of it in 2 years would be seen as such a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased power on the transmitter, more diaspora focused programming, engaging with them and improving the service where it can be such as considering band changes in liaison with the ITU should this be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hosting a HTML/CSS/JavaScript static site</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/hosting-a-htmlcssjavascript-static-site.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-16:pelican2/output/hosting-a-htmlcssjavascript-static-site.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ways to host a static website or blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DropBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;
Github pages is excellent for hosting pages generated by static website generators, it doesnt process php so wordpress and dynamic sites are not catered for. Just set up a repository in your github account publist it as a github page, clone the repository on your local machine, and set up a site blog here and add and push it to github and voila&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;
Dropbox can host a website / blog for you so long as it is not dynamic. There is a number of apps to do so , &lt;em&gt;scriptogr.am&lt;/em&gt; is one such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Google Hosting &lt;/strong&gt;
Previously the old google drive you could host one by uploading your website/blog and changing the sharing permissions. Now you can still do it on the New google drive by zipping up your website and uploading it via a script. The script will generated a url for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Hosting Company &lt;/strong&gt;
A traditional hosting company you can host a static or dynamic site depending on your requirements. You need a method of uploading it either via ftp or ssh or even wget from the console on the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find github pages the easiest way to do so but both dropbox and google drive are good locations to have personal pages like an online resume or cv.
GitHub pages and many static site generators use "MarkUp" languages such as MarkDown which is great for publishing text and documents without formatting information.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Static website generators</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/static-website-generators.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2015-01-09:pelican2/output/static-website-generators.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Static site generators I have looked at recently&lt;/h2&gt;

The Station has agreed to keep the service going until 2017, although have still committed to its closure, and plan a wind down of the service by reducing hours and power it seems, the announcement has to be welcomed and hopefully gives space and time for the value of the service to be appreciated by the broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Using TeX to write documents</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/using-tex-to-write-documents.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-12:pelican2/output/using-tex-to-write-documents.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Acadmeic document formatting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first exposure to TeX(http://www.tex.org) was many moons ago in college, while my reports were typed up using wordperfect formating them subsequently to TeX for its calculus equations was necessary.
About ten years ago, I began using LaTeX to format some informational documents using LaTeX. These tended to use MikTeX and generated into PDF's using pdfplatex. As a result I was often asked by academic friends to help them use LaTeX.
I also got into using various stylings to produce other documents for myself such as a Resume and Invoices.
What I like about TeX is that it allows you to produce documents consistently, and abstracts the presentation from the content, and allows you to after composing your document to then format it for differnet output be it pd, dvi, pdf or html.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Favourite Language</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/favourite-language.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-12-01:pelican2/output/favourite-language.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;These are my favourite computer languages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java - I think Java is so universal on many devices it is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C - I think c is the daddy of all languages in a way and needs to be learned since the concepts are universal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl - Always amazed how I often have to go back to Perl to do some tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python - More recently I have used Python for some data analysis, really impressed with using it with Anaconda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript - is the last language I would add to the list, more so because its gets you programming for a webpage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of interested parties met in the RIA for a press conference chaired by a diaspora rights campaigner Noreen Bowden, with a technical informaional presentation from Enda O'Kane a former RTE employee, and researcher into its services. Notable contributions were made including one from the priest and broadcaster Fr. Brian Darcy.
The arguments for closure seem solely on price, and in the scheme of things it seems a minor saving.
The ability of Long Wave to be received by people in the UK and in parts of Ireland with poor FM / DAB coverage seem evident, however the crucial arguement is the demographic who listen via Long wave, are older and the proposed alternatives for them either are not available, or not available to them. An elderly Irish person in the UK who use RTE Radio as a connection to home, from coverage of GAA sports to News and requests, see it a vital connection, and to say its no more unless you listen online or via satellite seems uncaring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Adventures with DocBook</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/adventures-with-docbook.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-11-12:pelican2/output/adventures-with-docbook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Producing documents with DocBook&lt;/h2&gt;

Some years ago I got into doing academcic styled how-to documents in work and LaTex(&lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org"&gt;http://www.latex-project.org&lt;/a&gt;) seemed appropriate, since i would want it either as a PDF or in HTML on the LAN server, since it was a windows environment I was using MikTeX(&lt;a href="http://www.miktex.org"&gt;http://www.miktex.org&lt;/a&gt;), progressing on to using LaTeX for a presentation I had to give to colleages, and even rendering some notes to HTML. I migrated to TexLive and using Ubuntu for a while and all my letters and invoices were done in TeX. I have lapsed some what recently from using it but it may recently got back into it a bit in tandem with using static site generators .&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Postponement of Closure of Long Wave 252</title><link href="http://conorgilmer.github.io/pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Conor Gilmer</name></author><id>tag:conorgilmer.github.io,2014-10-15:pelican2/output/postponement-of-closure-of-long-wave-252.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed&lt;/h2&gt;

It is especially underhanded since the reason for the abolition of Medium Wave, was that Long Wave was a better option for RTE and would bring about better reception in areas of the South of England.

&lt;p&gt;After using many IDE's in the past, JBuilder particularly, I happened upon Eclipse. Ok it is a big download, and does require a bit getting used to like any software package. The things I liked were the fact you could add plugins, add in JUnit, add in Apache Ant to run builds, have a built in server, version control, the thing which sold it to me was hot deploying with apache ant, like having one one build to deploy to your local server, or development server, and one to deploy on the test server.
I also liked that you could customise eclipse to whatever language/system you were using be it a legacy version of java, or C or another language.

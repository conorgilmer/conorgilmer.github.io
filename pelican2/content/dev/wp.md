Title: Wordpress Plugins

##My Favourite WP Plugins

Wordpress is such an omnipresent CMS now it is hard to avoid, here are a list of my favourite plugins to enhance the functionality of it

+ Contact Form 7 (free)
+ JetPack (some free some paid)
+ Google XML Sitemaps
+ Visual Composer (Paid ~ â‚¬20a)
+ Options Framework
+ Soliloquy (slider)
+ Wordpress SEO
+ Wordpress Backup to Dropbox
+ Share Buttons by AddToAny


While you can get plugins to add stats, I tend to add the code via the editor to the footer
+ Google Analytics 
+ Piwik

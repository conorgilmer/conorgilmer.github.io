Title: Livigno Italy

##Livigno my first skiing week holiday
Well Livigno was chosen rather than andorra as our first week aways skiing. It is a few years since my initial skiing exploits when working and living in Norway, and this no doubt would be somewhat different.
It was package deal with Crystal Ski, and while it had some of the benefits of a package deal some annoyances like the accommodation not being great, and the bus link to the main lifts were a hassle, leaving you somewhat stranded and unable to get back to the apartment.
One or two of the lifts and runs were not working or available due to the weather and conditions of the slopes and this also limited our holiday. However there was some excellent sking over the montelino side and up high, and as ever one or two bumps and embarrassments par for the course.
There was some other annoyances such as a deposit on the locker which was only returned in part, an undocumented price hike in taxi prices, and a insurance on the ski equipment not included in the inital price which left a bad taste in the mouth pocket etc. One other thing was I found my boots and skis were not the best, perhaps I was blessed in Norway with top equipment, and the skis blunted by poor under foot conditions.
On the positives it overall was quite good value for money, some good apres ski,and despite bad weather around europe the conditions were good to ski in.

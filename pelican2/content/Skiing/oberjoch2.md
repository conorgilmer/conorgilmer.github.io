Title: Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang 2014

##My Thoughts on 2014 Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany
Well I was invited back by the specker gang, so i jumped at the chance when things worked out for me that I could go. Pretty much the same crew, and the same venue everything was expected. Was worried when told the first evening that I was to guide a totally blind skier, but somehows we managed it. Still those dreaded drag lifts annoyed me, but some of the runs particularly over near the austrian border were good fun.
The same format as the previous year, which meant things were less of a surprise to me. Some nights out, some singsongs and being beaten by a V.I.P. at the nail game.
Again an exellent gang to go aways with and I hope to go again in the future. While the resort is adequate many would welcome a change to a larger ski resort.

Title: Oberjoch/Bad Hindelang

##My Thoughts on Oberjoch / Bad Hindelang, Allgau, Germany
Well a leap into the unknown for me with the specker ski gang, guiding a V.I. skier for the first time went much better than I expected.
My initial worries were waylayed by the gang and I hope I proved that I could ski a little and guide a VI skier.
I was assisted by having to guide an excellent skier. Also hanging out with a guy who i know since I was ten, which is 30 years was another bonus.
Oberjoch is a small ski resort, with those dreaded drag lifts we detest, it is suitable for beginners and for the VI gang I think it was grand.
The set up of having a different restuarant each evening was good fun, including the mad frenchmans which was memorable to say the least. Some sing songs and visit to the (in)famous josefs had to be done.
Some memorable skiing moments, such as around the resevoir and off the piste, and some spills humbled us all no doubt.
A great bunch to go aways with and I really enjoyed it.

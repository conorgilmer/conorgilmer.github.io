Title: Ski Amade Region

##My Thouhts on the Ski Amade Region in Austria
Well it I returned to Austria after some years aways, this time with the specker ski gang. I found the ski amade region was massive and had a lot of variety of skiing, to be honest i had never heard of it prior to it being suggested by one of the gang, probably due to the fact it doesnt feature in the Irish package ski hoilday itenery or in my weekend break ski book.
I was really impressed again by both the resort, and by the help of the ski lift people, particulalry when I was guiding a V.I. skier. Whilst the weather could have been better, the skiing conditions were excellent.
The Austrian set up of a hotel / pension with a three course meal each evening also meant the cost was reduced also saved us from the hassle of finding different dining places each evening.
It is far from a party zone where we were, and while we had some good nights outourselves, if thats what you are looking for other resorts are more suitiable i feel.
Overall it was a great holiday and no doubt it is a place I shall seek to return to.

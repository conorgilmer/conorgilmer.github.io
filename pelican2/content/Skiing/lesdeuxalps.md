Title: Les Deux Alps 

##Les Deux Alps, France
Well my first trip to france, was fine, 'cept for getting sick for a couple of days I did enjoy it. A touch more expensive than italy for skiing but the apartment was next to the main lift. Skiing conditions were not the best since there was not as much snow as you would have liked - up on the glacier was ok, it was one of the reasons why we chose a High Altitude resort.
The scenery was immense.
Got slagged for my ample Calves..... skiboot filling ones they are.
Nearly killed this dutch/belgian snowboarder, when he turned right in front of me, perhaps the highlight of my trip;)
The Apres Ski - what I could go to was grand a bit more fun than in italy.
I found the people very friendly - "Daccord?", especially when you tried the cupla focail francais.
Amazed at how much french you can remember - especially when you have to state your symptoms to the pharmacist, who helped me get back to myself. Of the week I missed maybe 2 days being sick, but thankfully got a good 4 days which was nice. Overall I think I preferred the resort to Livigno, a bit more expensive, but not the manic queuing, and "scamos" which annoyed me.

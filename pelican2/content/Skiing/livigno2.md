Title: Livigno Italy Two

##Livigno Return
Well a return to Livigno in North Italy for some skiing. A very inexpensive trip it was our last minute panic resulted in us getting a very good deal.
I had some issues with going, since i had prefered les deux alps to livigno previously.
Ok the air trip wasn't the best, having to land back in dublin on the outward journey was a worry, however we got to bergamo and then faced the mammoth bus trip.
Accommodation this year was excellent, and the conditions were excellent for skiing since there was fresh snow, and Tuesday was brilliant trying to ski during a blizzard. Also the bizarre apres ski in the chalet on that day with dancing germans and dutch people, and the chef with the Indian head gear and knife in hand....
thursday night was a good night out myself an mike playing guitars and singing songs with some Danish engineers.
Over all trip was much much better than the previous trip to Livigno, it was excellent value, the ski conditions were excellent, all runs open, and clear since there wasnt the queues of previous years, my equipment was the best I had yet, brand new, ok some issue with the flights and bus trip but it was a great trip.

Title: Ski Gear

##Thoughts on Ski Gear
One of the expensive parts of going on a ski trip is getting the gear. For me the basics are Ski Jacket, Salopettes, Gloves, and Ski socks. While you can use shades, having both shades and goggles is good. The rest you can rent.
As I am now a convert to wearing a helmet, a helmet is perhaps the easiest and best thing to get if you are getting more equipment, it is small enough to get into you baggage without extra charges flying.
For me boots are a crucial part of ski holiday i have always rented boots, and they have tortured me at times, in recent years the boots have got better, but I have toyed with the idea of purchasing my own, but have turned aways due to the extra baggage, hassle of bringing them and the fact in I often find my feet shrink when on ski holidays, or the boots dry or change so i end up switching them.
I cant see the value and benefit of buying skis, it takes to much to transport them, to a resort form ireland, and sharpening and servicing them is either up to you or you pay for it, so getting shop skis always suits me, it also allows you to try different types of skis.

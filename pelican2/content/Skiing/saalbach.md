Title: Saalbach / Hinterglem

##My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria
Well after a success of our trip to Kirchberg/Kitxbuel in 2009, we decided to give Saalbach a try. My ski book recommended it for both skiing and apres-ski, and it did not dissappoint. 
The accommodation in Pension Esian was excellent, the Sauna was much appreciated for the tired limbs, and the meal each evening was welcome. The chefs evening off was also a good trip up on the piste machine to the mountain challet resturant, and tobganning down.
The skiing was excellent, and myself and Ivan and Lee had the pleasure of on both the monday and friday following the hotel owner on a traverse of the resort.
The kitsch apreski madness of the HinterAlm and Allo Josef was another memorable experience.
Again as in Kirchberg, the austrians seem to blend the ski, apres ski and indeed value for money quite well. If i was to highlight some negatives it would be the fact that the pension was on one side aways from the apres ski main area, and the fact that to ski back to the hotel meant trying to negotiate the horrible black run, which wasnt suitable for us all. Better planning of your day would be needed to ski home and get to the apres ski, and choosing one or the other would be needed. 
The fact you could ski down to the main gondala from the door was a major bonus for the resort.

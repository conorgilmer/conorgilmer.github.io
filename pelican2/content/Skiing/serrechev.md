Title: Serre Chevalier

##Serre Chevalier, France
An unusual place, not really on the radar of many Irish holiday makers. It was a bespoke holiday booking flights, connections, skipack, and accommodation separately, and it worked out quite well. Myself i travelled to turin then onto Serre Chevalier, and returned to Ireland via Grenoble.
 A very french resort, in that foreigners were by far in the minority.
After some misgivings about the lack of snow we were rewarded by our choice of venue with ample snow on the mounts and runs we were on, granted as the day went on some runs got moguly and slushy but thanks to some snow the friday before we went and indeed on the monday(very interesting to ski in) we were blessed with good conditions.
I would say my skiing peeked on the tuesday and I was quite lethargic on the wednesday and for the rest of the week, I think my skiing has improved and I tested myself more then in previous years.
The part of serre chevlaier we were in Chantamerle was very french and very quiet - the next hub up in Villeneuve was much more party like but still quite dormant I would say. I found the people very friendly and managed many an communication exchange en francais. Whilst 2 of my traveling companions had a bad experience in one restaurant, for the rest of the time it was excellent especially in "Le Kitz".
As a resort i would say it is good for the intermediate or advanced skier and definitely not for the novice skier. The long black run Luc Alpand tested knees and edurance as you had to negotiate this to get home of an evening and then it was very cut up slushy and heavy, it the morning it was crispy and icy and much better.

Title: Val Thorens

##Thoughts on Val Thorens
My third time skiing in France, this time in Val Thorens. I did find the resort very busy, but if you got through the intital lifts you could get to some areas which were clear. Overall the skiing was excellent, expecially on the clearer and higher runs. Some older lifts at the far end of the area was meant I invested in a balaclava/buff.
The resort itself i found very artificial and without character and the accommodation was adequate. I did like the fact you could effectively ski to your door, if you got high up on a late lift behind the resort although a well worn track had to be negotiated, and a missed turn could mean you were walking back upward to the apartment block.
It is a large ski area amidst a massive ski area, and a wrong turn could mean you had to by a one of ticket or bus trip to get back to the resort.
Some excellent skiing but the Resort itself i didnt enjoy that much.

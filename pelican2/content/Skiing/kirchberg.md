Title: Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel

##Ski Holiday in Kirchberg-Kitzbuhel
First time skiing in Austria, and I was impressed.
Accommodation was ok, except for the walk home with skis, the pension/hotel set up with meals worked out well, served by a herr gruber lookalike. Some excellent skiing on tuesday, wednesday morning and thursday, although crossing the top of the mountain on wednesday evening and friday made me regret leaving the balaclava at home... St. Paddys day we flew the flag like 2 ejeets but it was worth it, kitzbuel much more lively than kirchberg. Ivan ran close to getting a slapping for his backward skiing...Lots of super crazhey dutch people about there for some reason. Ski lifts were never a problem, except for one incident on the 1st day with high winds. The farmers plate meal, always undid any good the open air and exercise was doing. Friday doing the Hahnenkamm (or the bit of it they let you do) was another achievement, and the spill I had on it, I need to pay off the paparazzi for filming it...
I found Kitzbuhel more of a party town, and kirchberg quite quiet and being based in Kirchberg meant we had to aim to get back there from skiing and  mean Kitzbuhel was a taxi ride aways.

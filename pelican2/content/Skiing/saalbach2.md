Title: Saalbach / Hinterglem Take Two

##My Thoughts on Saalbach-Hinterglem Austria 2011
Well since we had such a good time the previous year we decided on a return to Saalbach, sadly we could not get to the same hotel, and the hotel we got while quite close to last year, was adequate, again it was difficult to ski home to it, and you were not high enough to ski down to the main gondola so a little walk was required. The set up was the same with a meal each evening, and the hotel had a sauna to warm those tired limbs. In hindsight storing the skis at the main lift would have been beneficial, but maybe we were blessed the previous year, our knowledge of the resort made is more aware of where to go and what to do and this helped us have an excellent trip.

Title: Adventures with DocBook

##Producing documents with DocBook##
About 10 years ago, i was introduced to using docbook for document production by a former colleague, and uber geek. Setting up a framework for document production which produced consistent professional looking documents with the ability to produce documents in differnet formats (RTF, PDF and HTML). Since XML/XSL was all the rage using DocBook seemed consistent with other technologies we were advocating and using. I suppose someone who had used LaTeX I was interested in it and used it, but always felt well this could have been done in LaTeX and also setting things up on a new machine or os seemed to take more time than I imagined it would have with LaTex.

Title: Will HTML5 kill off Flash

##As HTML5 grows hopefully it will see an end to Flash

It must be nigh on 15 years when I did my first and really only major Flash project an online information brochure with animation, nowadays some platform or templating framework would be a quicker to access and customise,  more web friendly and independent of using a plugin to drive it.

While flash has a role for animations and games maybe for web content HTML5 must be a better solution, more open, not needing a download to render it, even with conversion programs to convert flash to html5, surely using pure html5 is better.

The move by youtube to default to html5 is another indication that HTML5 will spell an end to Flash.

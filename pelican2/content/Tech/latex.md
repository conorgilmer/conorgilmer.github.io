Title: Adventures with TeX

##Producing documents with LaTeX##
As someone who is interested in information and document production technologies TeX was always going to feature. I used TeX a bit for some college documents particularly to do nice neat mathematics equations. Some years ago I got into doing academcic styled how-to documents in work and LaTex(<http://www.latex-project.org>) seemed appropriate, since i would want it either as a PDF or in HTML on the LAN server, since it was a windows environment I was using MikTeX(<http://www.miktex.org>), progressing on to using LaTeX for a presentation I had to give to colleages, and even rendering some notes to HTML. I migrated to TexLive and using Ubuntu for a while and all my letters and invoices were done in TeX. I have lapsed some what recently from using it but it may recently got back into it a bit in tandem with using static site generators .

Title: My Favourite Language

##This is my favourite computer language

* Java - I think Java is so universal on many devices it is essential.
* Perl - Always amazed how I often have to go back to Perl to do some tasks.
* Python - More recently I have used Python for some data analysis, really impressed with using it with Anaconda.

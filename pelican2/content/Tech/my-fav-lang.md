Title: Favourite Language

##These are my favourite computer languages

During an evening out with some other IT guys, we got discussing our favourite computer language and why, so I decided to list mine.
* Java - I think Java is so universal on many devices it is essential.
* C - I think c is the daddy of all languages in a way and needs to be learned since the concepts are universal
* Perl - Always amazed how I often have to go back to Perl to do some tasks.
* Python - More recently I have used Python for some data analysis, really impressed with using it with Anaconda.
* JavaScript - is the last language I would add to the list, more so because its gets you programming for a webpage.

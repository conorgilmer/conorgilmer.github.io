Title: Hosting a HTML/CSS/JavaScript static site

##Ways to host a static website or blog

* GitHubPages
* DropBox
* Google Drive
* Hosting Company

**GitHub Pages**
Github pages is excellent for hosting pages generated by static website generators, it doesnt process php so wordpress and dynamic sites are not catered for. Just set up a repository in your github account publist it as a github page, clone the repository on your local machine, and set up a site blog here and add and push it to github and voila

**Dropbox**
Dropbox can host a website / blog for you so long as it is not dynamic. There is a number of apps to do so , *scriptogram* is one such.

** Google Hosting **
Previously the old google drive you could host one by uploading your website/blog and changing the sharing permissions. Now you can still do it on the New google drive by zipping up your website and uploading it via a script. The script will generated a url for you.

** Hosting Company **
A traditional hosting company you can host a static or dynamic site depending on your requirements. You need a method of uploading it either via ftp or ssh or even wget from the console on the host.

I find github pages the easiest way to do so but both dropbox and google drive are good locations to have personal pages like an online resume or cv.

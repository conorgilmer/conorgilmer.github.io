Title: Eclipse IDE v NetBeans

##Eclipse v NetBeans

Have used both NetBeans and Eclipse from time to time, Eclipse i started using back in 2004 for java development, there is a lot you can do with it to meet your requirements. At one stage I found Eclipse faster than NetBeans but the more plugins installed in eclipse and updates to NetBeans i found NetBeans get faster. In general i found NetBeans better for me when i was doing a php project, and eclipse for java, the exception being using netbeans for java swing. I have only used Net Beans for a few years and it seems to improve each time, things like Java Hints,iand the GUI for doing swing dialogs found useful. Speed is still an issue i find with both, ofent just the editor can be quite slow, even with quite a modern machine.
As an apache ant user i found Eclipse suited me, I have only used maven on occasions and NetBeans is more suited for it.

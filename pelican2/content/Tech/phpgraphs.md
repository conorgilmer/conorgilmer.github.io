Title: Graphs in PHP

## Drawing graphs using php 

I have used perl(cgi), java and python to generate graphs, I have used awk to generate data for graphs, while they have their merits particulalry python, the requirement to use a framework to have it online has meant in the past for some simple stats I have used php. Also there is some excellent javascript and online facilities to generate graphs and of course offline using gnuplot, openoffice and excel but i like dynamically generating them using php.
I was using a unlicenced free to use and modify phpMyGraph very happily for some work stats and some personal projects. I like although it some issues i have had with it are the absence of a pie chart, and also returning the png image has often been problematic for inserting in pdfs(maybe i keep doing it wrong), but for easy of use and producing quality graphs i do like it.
Recently I used a GPL graph drawing libary Libchart, it has some basic charts such as Line, Bar and Pie, and i found it excellent for the small job i had to do.

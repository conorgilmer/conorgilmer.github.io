<h1>My Projects</h1>
Here is where I am going to put up stuff various projects I have worked on over the years, including my embarrassing efforts from all those years in college, to little work rounds I used for my computer usage, to some examples of programs I hackabout with to teach myself various things.<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="#PR">Proportionality of Electoral Systems</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#EQUI">Equipotentials</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#SED">Batch File Conversion</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#FLV">JWMediaPlayer Page and Playlist Generator</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#ANT">ANT Build files</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#TEX">LaTeX Templates</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#THREECARD">Three Card Game (Monty Hall Paradox)</a> </li> 
<li><a href="#TALKS">Talks/Presentations</a> </li> 
</ul>
<a name="PR"></a><h2>Proportionality of Electoral Systems</h2>
<p>
I looked at the election results for a few elections, in Ireland and the UK comparing the seats obtained versus the actual proportion of first preference votes, and how "Fair" the systems are. In Ireland it is the PR-STV system, and in the UK it was both the traditional First past the post, and the List system used in the European Elections there.<br>
I suppose I used this to teach myself some PHP, the library used for the graphs was <a href="http://phpmygraph.abisvmm.nl">http://phpmygraph.abisvmm.nl</a> which I found easy to use and did the job for me(2009).
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.webwayz.com/grapher/bounce.php">Bounce - Seat Allocation Vs Vote Proportion</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>To Do:
	<li>Add more elections, make them selectable.</li>
	<li>Dig out Java version using JFreeChart</li>
	<li>Add simulation of Alternative Vote(AV) and Alternative Vote+(AV+) (2010), for the UK.</li>
	<li>Look at Australian System.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="SED"></a> <h2>Batch File converter using SED - for Chessbase file conversion</h2>
<p>
I like using old tools, and here was an example of using an old tool SED(stream editor) to do a batch file conversion for ChessBase files from one version to another. I was based on feeding in the files to sed and sed using a "rosetta stone" with regular expressions to change the files to the new format, hence making the existing chessbase database of games readable into the later version of chessbase.<br>
Rosetta.txt file contatins the regular expression
<code> s/oldstring/newstring/g</code>
<ul>
<li><a href="SedFiles/sedconvert.txt"> Batch File</a></li>
<li><a href="SedFiles/rosetta.txt"> "Rosetta Stone"</a></li>
<li><a href="SedFiles/readme.txt">Batch file conversion Readme file</a></li>

</ul>

</p>
<a name="FLV"></a> <h2>JWMediaPlayer Webpage and Playlist Generator</h2>
<p>
I tend to use Perl to format pages for my photos, for some years using Marc's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.micapeak.com/webshow">webshow</a> which I highly recommend. To display Videos online I have hacked/Cobbled together a Perl script based on marcs to generate a page and playlist for use with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.longtailvideo.com">JWMediaPlayer</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="webshowflv/flvplgen.zip">Zip File</a></li>
<li><a href="webshowflv/readme.txt">Readme file</a></li>

</ul>



</p>


<a name="ANT"></a> <h2>ANT</h2>
<p>
I never got into using make for building projects, compliling etc., used it some times when unavoidable but, when working with Java I got into using ANT <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache ANT</a>. I just like the way I could use it to clean compile, jar and run, even selecting what compiler to use, and would do the same on Linux as Windows, however i was really sold on it when using Eclipse that it could Hot Deploy a JAR/WAR/EAR(without stopping/starting) to the server(JBoss/Jetty/Tomcat), and could be run from with in eclipse.
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="buildbasic.xml">buildbasic.xml</a> all, clean, compile, jar, run</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="buildeclipse.xml">buildeclipse.xml</a> all, clean, compile, jar, run(2004)</li>
</ul>
<ul>To Do:
	<li>Make the eclipse build more generic for Tomcat.</li>
	<li>Look at JAM.</li>
	<li>Look at Maven and Wicket.(2010)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Java Swing HTTP Sender</h2>
<p>
Simple enough Java Swing HTTP Sender, to configure a http send and accept a response. This was used to test when working on mCommerce, and I also used it on Mobile Information Server.
<br>
e.g. you want to send a http request e.g. http://ipaddress:portnum/program?field1=val1&amp;field2=val2&amp;field2=val2&amp;...
</p>
<p>
<ul>On my server with MIS/Yap on it
<li><a href="http://localhost/yoda.html"> YODA </a> Yaporama Online Data Application</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost/yogi.html"> YOGI </a> Yaporama Online Gateway Interface</li>
</ul>
</p>


<a name="TEX"></a> <h2>TeX/LaTeX files Templates I use to make documents</h2>
<p>
Here are some tex file templates I use to make documents using <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MiKTeX</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="TexFiles/letter.tex">Letter.tex</a></li>
<li><a href="TexFiles/fax.tex">Fax.tex</a></li>
<li><a href="TexFiles/formalreport.tex">formalreport.tex</a></li>
<li><a href="TexFiles/fnspec.tex">fnspec.tex</a></li>
</ul>
I must add my tex - presentation.
</p>


<h2>Chess Rating Estimator</h2>
<p>
A simple program to estimate the gain or loss of chess rating points. Using the +16 points for a win, + or - 4 points for every 100 grading points your opponents rating differs from you, I cant say that correctly.
<ul>
	<li><a href="rating.php">rating.php</a> - Simple PHP Version(1 grading)</li>
	<li><a href="RatingsSwing.jar">RatingsSwing.jar</a> - Swing Version</li>
	<li><a href="Ratings.java">Ratings.java</a> - Command Line Version</li>	
	<li><a href="RatingsCalc.c">RatingsCalc.c</a> - Command Line Version</li>		
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Programs from College projects</h2>

</p>

<a name="EQUI"></a> <h2> Numerical Simulation of Equipotentials in an Electrolytic tank using the Relaxation Algorithm - Finite Difference Method</h2>
<p>
My College physic project which I wrote a program to simulate the experimental observations had the catchy name above. The experiment and the orignal simulation program(BASIC and Pascal) was devised and written by Dr. Mulligan. <br>
I wrote my program initally in Modula-2 then converted it into Pascal which was the language of choice in the Physic Department and produced a number of iterations of this program to simulate points of equipotential in an electrolytic substance. The crude output which was stored in a txt file I read in to a program called "mongo" using Fortran and produced a snazzy graph. <br>
Coming soon - jpeg image of the results and TEX file of my formal report including code.<br>
(I have tended to re-write this project, to learn a new language, e.g. C, or Java or Java with Swing.
<ul>

<li><a href="RelaxSim100.jar">Java Swing 100*100 Jar File with PlotGraph </a>(circa 2003 Java/Swing incarnation)</li>
<li><a href="Screenshot2all.png">Output Generated by Swing App 100*100 array</a></li>
<li><a href="Screenshot2middle.png">Output Generated by Swing App Middle array</a></li>

<li><a target="_blank" href="applets/RelaxSimOne.html">Java Applet with PlotGraph </a>(circa 2000/2003)</li>
<li>equipotentials.mod</li>
<li>equipotentials.tex</li>
<li>equi.c (circa 1995 incarnation)</li>
<li>equi.java (circa 2000 incarnation)</li>
</ul>
To Do:
So much of this I must give it its own page, the iterations should flip between (1,1) to (100,100) and (100,100) to (1,1) to give it more balance? Add the re-run item to the 100*100, and radio buttons to the applet, and graph to WEST in Grid Layout.

<h2>Roman Numerals</h2>
<p>
One of the exercises I seemed to get to do more than once was to write a conversion program from Arabic/Decimal Numbers to Roman numerals. Again this seemed to be both an exercise in using conditional logic and some arthemetic to work out what was what.<br>
I have two versions one which I wrote in Java for college and later made a applet out of it, the other I wrote in perl, when I was refreshing my memory of perl. <br>

<ul>
<li><a href="romans.html"> Romanizer Java Applet</a></li>
<li><a href="romans.pl"> Roman numeral convertor in perl</a></li>
<li>Roman Numeral convertor in php(somewhere on the old PC)</li>

</ul>

<a name="THREECARD"></a> <h2>Three Card Game Paradox</h2>
<p>Years ago I came across this three card game, it is where there is three cards, with a prize behind one card, and the player choses one card, then the computer removes one card which doesnt have the prize from the other two cards, and offers the player the chance to stay with the card they have chosen or change to the other card, the thing is most people stay and statistically this is not the best option since you are twice as likely to win by choosing to change. I wrote a program to play the game in BASIC, and some years later in C, and then java, also run a simulation of a number of games to prove the statistical benefit of changing.<br>
<code>Results:<br>
Sticking wins you 9973 times.<br>
Changing wins you 20027 times.<br>
Changing wins more times. 66% of the time.<br>
</code>

</ul>
This is actually called the "Monty Hall Paradox", after a US Game Show I seen recently on Mythbusters which promted me to dig it off my old PC hard drive, the played the game a number of times to prove the theory.

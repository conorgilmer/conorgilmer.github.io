I suppose to be differential in website look and feel and function, I have always favoured, more obscure or less common web content management systems. In the past various java/jsp based CMSâ€™s with the usual hosting issues, and even before that a perl cgi/perl script based system more recently i have had to conform to more LAMP based ones even then php-nuke or nucleus the list is quite extensive, I have experienced the benefits and the flaws of many CMS platforms.

Recently I have deployed 4 wordpress sites, and while I am a big fan of it,especially its plugins, and you can easily see why it is the market leader so to speak, my big fear is that all sites will look and function the same and lose the variety and specificity which is beneficial. For some reason I always favoured wordpress over joomla perhaps it is me but i never liked a joomla site i did, and always preferred the wordpress or simplecms or A.N. Other.

My advice would be if your going to do a site or blog try another CMS other than the big two and see how you get on, and if you have to revert back to the big two try a different theme customise your own just do something different.

I have been using Google Drive for a while (and I used google docs before drive) and whilst I like it and it has been great, It had two annoyances for me. One being the fact that it doesnt have a good linux app. I use Ubuntu, Mint, Windows and a Mac and not to have full app / drive integration is an annoyance, I tried some hacks from the web to make it work, but none functioned completely for me.

Another annoyance is the fact that google drive  behaves differently if your using different browsers having different functionality and features on older or no google browsers e.g. unable to upload a directory, rather you have to upload files individually, maybe they want to force you to use the latest version of their browser.

In Recent weeks I have been using DropBox, and for me it works fine as an app (virtual drive) on all my Platforms. I had looked at it before and i had some issues in linux with it, but the app works now no problem for me. 

I am using both Drive and Dropbox (to be sure to be sure) drop box for a code repository, since its easier to flat copy the directory.

What makes a good IDE, or Editor, for me it is largely horses for courses, and what is salient for one situation may not be for another.
For me a good IDE must be available on multiple platforms, must allow editing and excution as you develop, must have debugging to identify issues, must allow for quick and efficient editing, and present code in a legible GUI, and allow access to browse the libraries used etc.

For editing I always default to Vim, I never got into emacs, the ve/emacs is a great divide amongst IT-erati although recently I have been using Sublime a good deal.

I have dabbled in various Static website/blog generators, which seem to be increasing in popularity. 
* [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com)
* [Nikola](http://www.getnikola.com)
* [JBake](http://www.jbake.org)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Hyde](http://hyde.github.io/)

Overall I like Pelican and JBake (by virtue of my java past) many of these are excellent for blogs, and for documentation but aslo for types of website. Static website generators seem to dove tail into many cloud hosting services such as github pages.

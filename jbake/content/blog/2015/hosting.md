There are a number of cloud hosting services for publishing a personal site/blog, they re excellent for hosting a static website/blog, where they dont require dynamic genertion or a CMS..
github pages (upon which this site is hosted) is an example of such a service, another one is Dropbox, and google drive. Many of the Static Site generators are configured to publish directly to these services.

  			<a href="blog/2015/hosting.html"><h1>Hosting Static Sites</h1></a>
  			<p>16 January 2015</p>
  			<p><p>There are a number of cloud hosting services for publishing a personal site/blog, they re excellent for hosting a static website/blog, where they dont require dynamic genertion or a CMS..<br/>github pages (upon which this site is hosted) is an example of such a service, another one is Dropbox, and google drive. Many of the Static Site generators are configured to publish directly to these services.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2015/pelican.html"><h1>Pelican</h1></a>
  			<p>02 January 2015</p>
  			<p><p>I used <a href="http://www.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> for a simple site/blog, of the newer static website genertors, it is probably the one i favour. It is integrated fairly well for publishing to github pages, while it is python based, no specific python coding skills are required. It uses Markdown (and other languages) to be rendered into HTML.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2014/static.html"><h1>Static Website generators</h1></a>
  			<p>29 December 2014</p>
  			<p><p>I have dabbled in various Static website/blog generators, which seem to be increasing in popularity.<br/>* <a href="http://www.getpelican.com">Pelican</a><br/>* <a href="http://www.getnikola.com">Nikola</a><br/>* <a href="http://www.jbake.org">JBake</a><br/>* <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a><br/>* <a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a></p><p>Overall I like Pelican and JBake (by virtue of my java past) many of these are excellent for blogs, and for documentation but aslo for types of website. Static website generators seem to dove tail into many cloud hosting services such as github pages.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2014/anaconda.html"><h1>Python - Anaconda</h1></a>
  			<p>10 August 2014</p>
  			<p><p>I have used some scripting languages in the past, mostly Perl. Python which is quite popular has many advocates. One thing I found Python is especially good at is data crunching. I found Anaconda an excellent tool for python.</p>

  			<a href="blog/2013/mampxampp.html"><h1>MAMP versus XAMPP</h1></a>
  			<p>28 November 2013</p>
  			<p><p>Both MAMP and XAMPP on the mac have their benefits, XAMPP because it is the same on other platforms, so its familiar, MAMP because its slicker and easy to use, is the one I favour and have been using for months, however I have noticed some annoyances.</p><p>CURL was trying to use curl to send a request to twitter api and code was fine but it didnt work error0 - tried the exact same code on Linux and Windows and it worked… I tried t on XAMPP and it also worked! which was when i noticed MAMP (my version had an old version of CURL)</p><p>One annoance is how MAMP Mysql allows you to have case sensitive table names etc., where SQL is no case sensitive, even if you rename the field/table it is better to delete and recreate </p><p>Another MySQL issue I had was the fact that since the version i had was configured for germans, it uses commas as decimal points and semi-colons as delimiters hence importing /exporting you have to be on your toes.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2013/corona.html"><h1>Moblie development with Corona SDK/Lua</h1></a>
  			<p>06 September 2013</p>
  			<p><p>Well I have been doing a small project to develop on Corona SDK with Lua. The resources online are excellent, and youtube videos seem to get you up and running very quickly. I like the fact you can develop both for Android and iOS with the same code base.</p><p>Lua (<a href="http://www.lua.org">http://www.lua.org</a>) is a nice language and with you can pick it up fairy quickly. I did feel like i was touching base with my educational qualifications, when using the physics library for bouncing etc.</p><p>Some tools i found useful were the Sublime Text editor initially, i did try eclipse some swings to get debugging to work, however i settled on using LuaGlider which i found handy and code completion is excellent.</p><p>The issues I had(have) was actually deploying on my phone, initially there was an issue in that to compile i had to down grade from Java 1.7 to 1.6, and also use the 32 version not 64. While it didn’t deploy to my phone it did install on others. As i searched i found it was to do with my phones processor the ARMv6 is no longer supported …dooh..</p><p>I did use an earlier Corona SDK version from 2011 which did deploy on my phone however it uses legacy libraries and not common modern ones especially such fundamental ones as widget.</p><p>I shall plow on…</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2013/cmschoice.html"><h1>Content Management Systems which to choose</h1></a>
  			<p>09 February 2013</p>
  			<p><p>I suppose to be differential in website look and feel and function, I have always favoured, more obscure or less common web content management systems. In the past various java/jsp based CMS’s with the usual hosting issues, and even before that a perl cgi/perl script based system more recently i have had to conform to more LAMP based ones even then php-nuke or nucleus the list is quite extensive, I have experienced the benefits and the flaws of many CMS platforms.</p><p>Recently I have deployed 4 wordpress sites, and while I am a big fan of it,especially its plugins, and you can easily see why it is the market leader so to speak, my big fear is that all sites will look and function the same and lose the variety and specificity which is beneficial. For some reason I always favoured wordpress over joomla perhaps it is me but i never liked a joomla site i did, and always preferred the wordpress or simplecms or A.N. Other.</p><p>My advice would be if your going to do a site or blog try another CMS other than the big two and see how you get on, and if you have to revert back to the big two try a different theme customise your own just do something different.</p></p>
  			<a href="blog/2013/storage.html"><h1>Dropbox and GDrive</h1></a>
  			<p>16 January 2013</p>
  			<p><p>I have been using Google Drive for a while (and I used google docs before drive) and whilst I like it and it has been great, It had two annoyances for me. One being the fact that it doesnt have a good linux app. I use Ubuntu, Mint, Windows and a Mac and not to have full app / drive integration is an annoyance, I tried some hacks from the web to make it work, but none functioned completely for me.</p><p>Another annoyance is the fact that google drive behaves differently if your using different browsers having different functionality and features on older or no google browsers e.g. unable to upload a directory, rather you have to upload files individually, maybe they want to force you to use the latest version of their browser.</p><p>In Recent weeks I have been using DropBox, and for me it works fine as an app (virtual drive) on all my Platforms. I had looked at it before and i had some issues in linux with it, but the app works now no problem for me. </p><p>I am using both Drive and Dropbox (to be sure to be sure) drop box for a code repository, since its easier to flat copy the directory.</p></p>

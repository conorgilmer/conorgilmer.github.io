I used [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com) for a simple site/blog, of the newer static website genertors, it is probably the one i favour. It is integrated fairly well for publishing to github pages, while it is python based, no specific python coding skills are required. It uses Markdown (and other languages) to be rendered into HTML.

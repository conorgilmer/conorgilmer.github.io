Title: Using TeX to write documents

##Acadmeic document formatting

My first exposure to TeX(http://www.tex.org) was many moons ago in college, while my reports were typed up using wordperfect formating them subsequently to TeX for its calculus equations was necessary.
About ten years ago, I began using LaTeX to format some informational documents using LaTeX. These tended to use MikTeX and generated into PDF's using pdfplatex. As a result I was often asked by academic friends to help them use LaTeX.
I also got into using various stylings to produce other documents for myself such as a Resume and Invoices.
What I like about TeX is that it allows you to produce documents consistently, and abstracts the presentation from the content, and allows you to after composing your document to then format it for differnet output be it pd, dvi, pdf or html.

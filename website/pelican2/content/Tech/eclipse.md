Title: Eclipse IDE

##Eclipse IDE for Java

After using many IDE's in the past, JBuilder particularly, I happened upon Eclipse. Ok it is a big download, and does require a bit getting used to like any software package. The things I liked were the fact you could add plugins, add in JUnit, add in Apache Ant to run builds, have a built in server, version control, the thing which sold it to me was hot deploying with apache ant, like having one one build to deploy to your local server, or development server, and one to deploy on the test server.
I also liked that you could customise eclipse to whatever language/system you were using be it a legacy version of java, or C or another language.

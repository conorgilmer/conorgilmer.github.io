##This is about the closure of rte lw as proposed

RTE has announced that its long wave service closure has been deffered until 2017. After pressure from various groups, encluding the GAA, emigrant groups, churches,i and Irish community representatives in the UK. The Station has agreed to keep the service going until 2017, although have still committed to its closure, and plan a wind down of the service by reducing hours and power it seems, the announcement has to be welcomed and hopefully gives space and time for the value of the service to be appreciated by the broadcaster.

Title: Save RTE Long Wave Press Conference in RIA

##Campaigners for the retention of the RTE 252 LW service host a press conference

A number of interested parties met in the RIA for a press conference chaired by a diaspora rights campaigner Noreen Bowden, with a technical informaional presentation from Enda O'Kane a former RTE employee, and researcher into its services. Notable contributions were made including one from the priest and broadcaster Fr. Brian Darcy.
The arguments for closure seem solely on price, and in the scheme of things it seems a minor saving.
The ability of Long Wave to be received by people in the UK and in parts of Ireland with poor FM / DAB coverage seem evident, however the crucial arguement is the demographic who listen via Long wave, are older and the proposed alternatives for them either are not available, or not available to them. An elderly Irish person in the UK who use RTE Radio as a connection to home, from coverage of GAA sports to News and requests, see it a vital connection, and to say its no more unless you listen online or via satellite seems uncaring.

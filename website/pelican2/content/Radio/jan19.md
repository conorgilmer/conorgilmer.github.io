Title: The day RTE would have closed Long Wave

##Today would have been the day that RTE closed its long wave service


Well if it had not got a stay of execution, today would have been the day that we lost the RTE long wave 252 radio service, a service enjoyed by many people in the UK from Ireland or of Irish extraction, the demographic who avail of this service tend to be older and not part of the internet generation so the alternatives advocated by RTE do not suit them.

RTE should be positive for this service and not trying to reduce its power and devalue the service so as the removal of it in 2 years would be seen as such a bad thing.

Increased power on the transmitter, more diaspora focused programming, engaging with them and improving the service where it can be such as considering band changes in liaison with the ITU should this be beneficial.
